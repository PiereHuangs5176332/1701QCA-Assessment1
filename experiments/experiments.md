Ultrasonic Scensor Experiment

This experiment was done in class, by connecting the ultrasonic scensor with the microbit, we would be able to detect the distance with the ultrasonic scensor and the numbers on the microbit screen would change as the scensor feels something approaching or within its scensor redius.

#### Reflection ####

In this experiment, everything was new to me as i have never done coding before and have never touched microbit in my life, this experiment was definitly interesting and challenging, connecting the ultrasonic scensor with microbit isn't as easy as it looks and sound, as an simple miss connection between the microbit and the scensor could make the whole experiment end in a failure.

Unfortunately this experiment ended as a failure, but after all it is an experiment, and what is important is what have we learned from the experiment and the mistakes we have made. After some assistant from the course tutor, we were still unable to figure out what was done wrong on the moment as everything was connected to where it is supose to be (that was what we thought at the time), by looking at the tutorial for this experiment, we have found nothing at the moment, but after a few days of looking at it, the course tutor have came up with the solution and answer of why this experiment didn't work for us. 

For many experiments to work, it is important for us to make and complete a electricity circuit, it is like completeing a circle, and if we dont connect the end of a circle (start point and finish point)the circle would not be completed, where anything in the middle will not be connected as well, and this is the same as electricity circuits, in our experiment we didn't connect the ultrasonic scensor to the GND, where this cause the whole electricity circuit to fail as it didn't form a "circle", and this was what went wrong in our experiment and what I have learned from it.

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as an auto driving car, the ultrasonic scensor can be a scensor that triggers the car to stop when it is too close to other cars or things on the road, the future is limitless as this technology can be more advance than now or it could already be used in auto driving cars that are still under development.
